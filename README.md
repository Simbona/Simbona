- 👋 Hi, I’m @Simbona
- 👀 I’m interested in IP Networking, with a keen eye on automation and programmability. Cisco-savvy. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ANSIBLE, and will soon be posting scripts to make your networking tasks lighter.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on SD-WAN mini-projects: Say, optimal ways of implementing business intent overlays (over L2 technologies like EVPN and VXLANs).
